Steps to convert decimal floating point to binary floating:

e.g. 34.2342 base 10

Step #1:
- determine the sign of the given. That will be the sign bit. Postive sign has a "0" bit while negative has a "1" bit.

Step #2:

- convert the whole number part to binary (i.e. 34 base 10 --> ? base 2)

Step #3:
- convert fractional part to binary 
  (i.e. Step 3.1: multiply the fractional part by 2. If the result result contains a 1 in ones place, then bit is 1.
   Else, bit is zero. Then, take the current fractional part of the result and repeat Step 3.1 until fractional
   part becomes 0.)

At this point we have the sign bit, whole part to binary, and fractional part to binary.

Step #4:
- merge the converted whole part with the converted fractional part, preserving the point (i.e. dot between the converted whole and converted fractional)
- move the binary point (i.e. dot) to the left most after the first "1" bit. Make sure to keep track of how many
  time you move the binary point because the count will be your "exponent".
  e.g. 1111.1010 --> 1.1111010 x 2 ^ 3 or equivalent to 1.1111010E03 where E stands for "x base" where base 
       depends on the number system you want to represent. For example binary have base 2, so it will be "x 2".

Step #5:
- convert the exponent to binary. e.g. exponent 5 base 10 --> 0101

Step #6:
- save the sign bit, exponent, mantissa. (i.e. list it all those three).

Step #7:
- map out all those three to their respective bit place according IEEE 754. 

i.e. 

The first 23 bits for the mantissa zero extend as needed.
The next 8 bits for the exponent zero extend as needed.
The last bit, the MSD (Most Significant Digit) is the sign bit. Either 0 or 1.


Using biased exponent:

Actual exponent can be calculated by subtracting a constant 127 from the given biased exponent.

e.g. biasedExponent = 126
     actualExponent = biasedExponent - 127 = -1

127 - 127 = 0;
254 - 127 = 127

The range of an 8-bit "Actual" exponent is from -126 to 127. 
The range of biased exponent is from 1 to 254.

So, a biased exponent of 1 will give "Actual" exponent of -126.
251 will give "Actual" exponent of 127.

There are two types of special exponent:
- zero exponent which is 0000 0000.
- infinity or Nan (Not a number) which is 1111 1111. Don't confuse this with -1!
